# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

Because Haiku is the cheapest and fastest model, while Sonnet is the general-purpose coding workhorse. So a cost optimizer will often route subagents to Haiku when the task looks “mechanical” rather than “reasoning-heavy.”

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

Because the security auditor is meant to audit, not modify. Read-only tools are enough. Usually Read, Grep, Glob, and sometimes Bash for things like git diff, dependency inspection, or running safe checks are all what the tools needed.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

tf-writer uses inherit because Terraform-writing is usually treated as an implementation task that should match the parent agent’s model quality, context, and reasoning level, rather than being locked to a cheaper or fixed model.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — The delegation message showing Claude launched the security-auditor

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — The full cost optimization report
