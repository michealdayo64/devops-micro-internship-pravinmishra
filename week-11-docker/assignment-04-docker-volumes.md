# Assignment 4 — Docker Volumes

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will learn how Docker Volumes and Bind Mounts provide persistent storage for containers, deploying applications that retain logs and data even after containers are stopped or removed.

---

# Task 1 — Deploy a Standalone Application with Persistent Logs Using Bind Mounts

## Goal

Run an Nginx container (`myweb`) with a Bind Mount from `~/nginx-logs` to `/var/log/nginx`, verify the site loads, confirm logs are written, remove the container, and confirm the logs persist on the host.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `docker images`

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `docker search nginx`

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-40.png)

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Successful `docker pull nginx` (if applicable)

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-41.png)

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Creation of the `~/nginx-logs` directory

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-42.png)

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Output of `docker run` with the Bind Mount

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-43.png)

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Output of `docker ps` showing the running `myweb` container

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Browser displaying the Nginx Welcome Page

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Output of `ls ~/nginx-logs` showing `access.log` and `error.log`

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-46.png)

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Successful removal of the container

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-47.png)

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Output of `ls ~/nginx-logs` confirming the log files remain after the container has been removed

# Task 2 — Deploy Two Containers with Persistent Data Using Docker Volumes

## Goal

Create a custom network `mynetwork` and a Docker volume `shared-data`, build and run a `backend` container that writes to the shared volume and a `frontend` container that reads from it, and confirm updates are reflected immediately.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Project folder structure

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-49.png)

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `docker network create mynetwork`

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-50.png)

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `docker volume create shared-data`

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-51.png)

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Backend Dockerfile

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-52.png)

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Successful backend image build

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-53.png)

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Frontend Dockerfile

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-54.png)

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Successful frontend image build

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-55.png)

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Output of `docker ps` showing both containers

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-56.png)

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Successful execution of `docker exec backend curl http://localhost/write`

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-57.png)

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Browser displaying "Hello from Backend!"

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-58.png)

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Browser displaying "Test Data 1" after the first update

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-59.png)

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Browser displaying "Test Data 2 - New Update" after the second update

![paste file](screenshots/Screenshot-60.png)
