# Assignment 7 — Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this guided lab, you will create an internal ClusterIP Service for NGINX, call it by DNS and virtual IP, break and fix its selector, and prove readiness-aware endpoint routing.

---

# Task 1 — Deploy the Probed NGINX Workload

## Goal

Create two healthy, labeled NGINX Pods (readiness + liveness probes) as Service backends.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Two Ready Pods with labels and IPs

---

# Task 2 — Create and Inspect the ClusterIP Service

## Goal

Create `nginx-svc` (type `ClusterIP`, selector `app: nginx`, port 80) and inspect the Service, Endpoints, and EndpointSlices.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Service ClusterIP plus populated Endpoints and EndpointSlices

---

# Task 3 — Call the Service from a Client Pod

## Goal

Create a BusyBox `tester` Pod and call `nginx-svc` by short name, ClusterIP, and both short/FQDN via `nslookup`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Successful `wget` responses and `nslookup` output

---

# Task 4 — Break and Fix the Selector Contract

## Goal

Change the Service selector to `app: does-not-match`, confirm endpoints become empty and requests fail, then restore `app: nginx`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Empty endpoints during failure and restored endpoints after the fix

---

# Task 5 — Prove Readiness-Aware Routing

## Goal

Scale to one replica, apply a broken readiness patch, confirm the NotReady Pod is excluded from Service endpoints, then restore the healthy Deployment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — NotReady Pod with excluded endpoint, followed by restored endpoint membership

---

# Task 6 — Troubleshoot and Optionally Clean Up

## Goal

Verify the Service path, then optionally delete `tester` and `nginx-svc`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Final verification or optional cleanup output

### Notes

Write a short note describing what the lab demonstrated.

The lab demonstrated the implementation of a Kubernetes ClusterIP Service for internal communication between pods. I created a ClusterIP Service with a selector label targeting two Nginx pods. I then tested connectivity by accessing the service's ClusterIP from within the cluster and running a `wget` command to send a request to the Nginx service. The successful response confirmed that the service was correctly configured and enabled internal communication with the Nginx pods.
